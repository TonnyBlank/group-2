# AI Preventive Measures System

## Overview

The AI Preventive Measures System is an intelligent maintenance prediction and recommendation engine that helps prevent equipment failures before they occur. It uses machine learning algorithms and historical data analysis to provide actionable insights for maintaining ICT equipment in educational institutions.

## 🧠 Core AI Features

### 1. Equipment Health Scoring
**Algorithm**: Multi-factor health assessment
- **Issue Frequency**: Penalty based on number of recent tickets
- **Resolution Rate**: Bonus for high resolution rates
- **Time Since Last Issue**: Bonus for longer periods without issues
- **Equipment Age**: Consideration of equipment lifecycle

**Health Score Range**: 0-100
- **90-100**: Excellent (No maintenance needed)
- **70-89**: Good (Routine monitoring)
- **50-69**: Fair (Preventive maintenance recommended)
- **30-49**: Poor (Immediate attention required)
- **0-29**: Critical (Emergency maintenance needed)

### 2. Predictive Maintenance
**Prediction Factors**:
- Historical failure patterns
- Equipment type-specific vulnerabilities
- Environmental factors (location-based issues)
- Seasonal trends
- Usage patterns

**Urgency Levels**:
- **High**: Critical health score (<30) or immediate failure risk
- **Medium**: Frequent issues (3+ in 90 days) or declining health
- **Low**: Preventive maintenance for optimal performance

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Backend Algorithms

#### Health Score Calculation
```python
def calculate_equipment_health_score(equipment_id):
    # Base score: 100
    # Penalty: -10 points per issue (max 50)
    # Resolution bonus: +0.3 points per % resolved (max 30)
    # Time bonus: +0.5 points per day since last issue (max 20)
    
    health_score = 100 - issue_penalty + resolution_bonus + time_bonus
    return max(0, min(100, health_score))
```

#### Predictive Analysis
```python
def predict_maintenance_needs():
    for equipment in all_equipment:
        health_score = calculate_equipment_health_score(equipment.id)
        
        if health_score < 30:
            # Critical maintenance needed
            urgency = 'high'
            estimated_cost = 500
        elif recent_tickets >= 3:
            # Frequent issues detected
            urgency = 'medium'
            estimated_cost = 200
        elif health_score < 60:
            # Declining health
            urgency = 'low'
            estimated_cost = 100
```
